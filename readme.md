# Programming project

One programming assignment will be given during this course.
There is no strict deadline, but you must submit it at least one week before the exam.
The grade for programming assignment will be worth 20% towards your grade for this course.
The preferred way of submission is by email (include source code, executable file and program description - either as attachments or links to repositories for downloading them), but you can arrange transfer of files by USB flash drive or other digital media.
You should be prepared to give also a demonstration of your program.

New!!! Description of the problem for Programming project is available for download.

A couple of sample files of input data are available for testing purposes.

The `sample_input_2025_1.txt` describes graph with 10 vertices and the "sum of difficulty levels" should be 682.
The `sample_input_2025_2.txt` describes graph with 100 vertices and the "sum of difficulty levels" should be 2180.
The `sample_input_2025_3.txt` describes graph with 400 vertices and the "sum of difficulty levels" should be 19674.
The `sample_input_2025_2a.txt` describes graph with 100 vertices and the "sum of difficulty levels" should be 2176.
The `sample_input_2025_3a.txt` describes graph with 400 vertices and the "sum of difficulty levels" should be 19663.

Note that in general case correct solutions may have different sets of edges or even different number of edges in them.
